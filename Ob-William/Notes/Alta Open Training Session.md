#### Questions
- User schedules, what are they and what do they affect?
	- Control times to access doors
- How do you set up automation to access groups?
	- App marketplace, my apps section
- How to pull door Schedule for the day
	- Not possible currently, will look into it and let me know
- Locking door after start of event, unlock before end
	- Check to see if unlock 1 hour to 1 hour
- Custom field import? If possible, maybe add person profile link back to Rock

#### Notes
- Main dashboard, top right shortcut to get to offline devices
- Custom fields, may be able to add the person profile link to Rock to that
- Can tune each reader individually, might need to for some problem doors
- Can create custom dashboards
