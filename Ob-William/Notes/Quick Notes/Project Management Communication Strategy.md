1st email DONE

Good Afternoon Fellowship Staff!

We have some exciting changes to RockHelp support! We are pleased to announce that we will be moving support requests to Rock!

We are planning this change to take effect this Thursday, February 9th.

What does that mean?

- When you need help with anything Rock related or if you have any questions about how Rock works (or how it can work better for you), you will have a new place to add your requests!

Ok, so what do I do?

- There will be a new button on the staff homepage for support, click it to see our support page, then click RockHelp (more support options coming soon). From there, fill in your question or request and click save.

What happens to the RockHelp email?

- Moving forward, this new process will be the way to request support for Rock. If you email RockHelp, you will get a reply with a link directly to the support page. Just copy from the email you sent, paste into the form, and click save.

So, why the change?

- Migrating to Rock will give us more flexibility and transparency in working through requests. This will also allow us to upgrade more easily and improve support for you in the future, all while providing you better communication on your support requests.

Anything else I should know?

- These changes will be live on Thursday Feb. 9th. If you want more details on what this looks like and how it works, I've attached a pdf with screenshots.

As always, please let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you,

William Waterhouse
