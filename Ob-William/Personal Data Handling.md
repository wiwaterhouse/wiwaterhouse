Please note the right to delete your data is ==not absolute, and not all companies are located in a jurisdiction where privacy regulations have been adopted.== Some companies will fulfill your deletion request immediately, while others might tell you they are not obligated by law to delete your data.

- This is a company that provides a service for individuals to request companies to provide the personal data that has been collected and for it be deleted. There have been several new companies to offer this service and I expect they will be more common moving forward.
- Currently, Arkansas does not have any specific policies or laws requiring organizations to delete or provide users' personal data upon request.

- The above link  details how privacy laws differ by country and state. For now, Arkansas does not have specific data privacy laws in or around requests for deletion. However, many states are starting to adopt more strict policies and laws around this.

#### What Are the Three Rights Under the Privacy Act?
The three rights include the right to request records, subject to Privacy Act exemptions; the right to request a change to records that are not accurate, relevant, timely or complete; and the right to be protected against unwarranted invasion of privacy resulting from the collection, maintenance, use and disclosure of personal information.

- Notably, no specific right to have data deleted.

#### Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)
The Federal Trade Commission was mainly created to deal with issues arising from businesses employing shady financial practices. However, the FTC also functions as the government’s watchdog for data privacy, at least where businesses are concerned.
Under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which brought the FTC into existence, the FTC prevents companies and financial institutions from engaging in “unfair or deceptive acts or practices” toward their customers.
This section prevents companies from misrepresenting how they handle your data. For example, Facebook made several false claims in the years leading up to a [2012 FTC lawsuit](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2011/11/facebook-settles-ftc-charges-it-deceived-consumers-failing-keep-privacy-promises), including misleading users about the visibility of posts and information they marked as “private” or “friends only,” as well as sharing data with third-party apps.

- We MUST ensure we are accurately representing how personal data is collected and used. Review current privacy policy around data use and collection.

#### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

Example privacy policy from a church in California.

![[COPPA example.png]]

COPPA seeks to protect children under 13 from online predation, and imposes strict rules on how the data of these children is handled. 
This includes ==implementing verifiable parental consent (children cannot consent to the handling of their data)==, limiting marketing to children, providing a ==clear overview of what data gets collected, and deleting any information that is no longer necessary.==
Of course, there’s more to it than that, and if you’re interested in learning all the details, the FTC has a clear [COPPA compliance guide](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions) on its website. 
However, because COPPA requirements are very strict, **most social media companies simply claim to not provide service to children under 13** to avoid having to comply. Unfortunately, this doesn’t prevent those children from simply creating an account on their own and sharing potentially dangerous personal information online, and the company can just shift the blame to the parents.
Owing to the lack of adequate protection, parents should take active measures to protect their children. Restricting access to social media sites via a filtering program is the easiest way to prevent children from accessing dangerous websites, and some ISPs provide such tools, as well.

- For compliance, we need to specify exactly the data collected and specify Fellowship Account not to be used/served for those under 13.

#### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA and CPRA)
California arguably has the best privacy laws in the United States. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CPA) was a [major piece of legislation](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) that passed in 2018, protecting the data privacy of Californians and placing strict data security requirements on companies. 
The CCPA draws many comparisons to the European GDPR, which is high praise considering the excellent data protection the EU affords its citizens. 
Among these parallels is the right of citizens to access all data a company has on them, as well as the ==right to be forgotten — or in other words, have your personal data deleted.== However, probably the most important similarity between the CCPA and the GDPR is how broadly they both interpret the term “personal data.”
Under the CCPA definition, **personal data is any “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.”**
This is a landmark definition that prevents data brokers and advertisers from collecting your personal data and profiling you, or at least makes it very difficult for them to do so.
The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) is another Californian act that amends the CCPA to expand its scope. Most importantly, it created the California Privacy Protection Agency, in charge of implementing the laws and making sure they’re followed.

- As we move forward, more policies and laws are being defined by states to more strictly control how companies and organizations handle user data. It would be prudent to start thinking we will be subject to more regulation in the future and prepare for that outcome, should it arrive.

States with current data privacy laws:
- California
- Colorado
- Connecticut
- Maryland
- Massachusetts
- New York
- Virginia
