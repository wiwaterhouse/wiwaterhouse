Attending RX 2025 was a valuable opportunity to connect with the wider Rock community, share ideas, and learn from peers and experts. The conference provided a dedicated space for team-building with our new teammates as well as an immersive environment to introduce the IT team to Rock as a whole.

Here is a list of some of the things I learned from the sessions I attended:
- Mindful use of AI tools
- New capabilities with the Helix plugin
- Rock Automations system
- Upcoming features with Rock v18 and future
- 



RX 2025 focused on reimagining digital ministry, leveraging new tools (AI, automation, Helix), and empowering churches to innovate while staying mission-driven. The conference highlighted new features coming in future Rock versions and strategies for thoughtfully integrating technology into aspects of church life and discipleship.
