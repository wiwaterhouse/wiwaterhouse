## Getting Started (classic)
- Checkin needs to know
	- Person
	- Group
	- Location
	- Schedule
- Ways to check in
	- Criteria based
		- grade/age/gender/birthdate
		- ability level
		- data view
	- Membership-based
		- already belongs
		- add on checkin
	- both of the above
#note difference between location and named location in Rock? A name
- Locations
	- NOT getting multiple thresholds for different services/schedules/congregations
- Schedules
	- Recommendation to share schedules as much as possible
- Checkin config
	- Configurations are group types
		- Allowed child group types make other types show up in configuration
	- Settings on kiosk
	- Place to organize groups
	- Recommendation to keep no group members in any groups, do not add on checkin
	- Recommendation to NOT have a checkin config per campus
	- Recommendation to go to 4 characters for code length
		- Slows down with more codes, checkin stops if runs out
		- ALL checkins generate codes, even without printing
		- Recycles at midnight
		- Shared across ALL campuses and checkin configs
		- Check to see if we're close to half of 13,000 for code availability per day
	- Full phone number checkin provides to checkin data what number was used to check in kid
		- May help with SMS check out codes??? #followup 
	- NO APOSTROPHES in any of the diplay settings for checkin
	- Registration mode only on manned kiosks
#questions 
- ~~What's the benefit to not having kids be members of groups?
	- No need to move kids during promotion
	- checkin by criteria
- ~~How to organize groups and group types across all campuses in checkin config?
	- USE group viewer instead of config
	- Unify config AND groups, customize locations
	- Locations will house the campus for reporting
- ~~I there a reason to allow duplicate checkin?~~
	- not really, just a church preference thing
