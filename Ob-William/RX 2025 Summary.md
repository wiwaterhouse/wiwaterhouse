## Rock Conference (RX 2025) Experience Summary

### Top 3 Things I Learned

**1. Digital Ministry Requires a First Principles Approach**

- Rebuilding digital ministry means focusing on mission over methods and truth over analogy.
- Digital ministry isn’t just online strategy—it’s using digital tools to amplify the church’s mission, break the Sunday-only mold, and empower participation.
- Integration of digital and analog approaches is essential; measure what matters (spiritual growth, life change) rather than just interactions.

**2. Rock RMS Innovations: Helix, Automations, and AI Agents**

- **Helix**: The next evolution of Lava, using HTMX for faster, interactive user experiences and modular, reusable code. Enables dynamic content and simplifies complex tasks without custom JavaScript or C#.
- **Automations**: Replaces old workflows with triggers and events, streamlining processes and improving clarity, logging, and extensibility.
- **AI Agents**: Rock is prioritizing agentic AI (goal-oriented agents) over generative AI, with new agent frameworks, skills, and tools coming in v19. These agents will automate tasks, enhance user experience, and integrate with Rock’s ecosystem.

**3. Data-Driven Discipleship and Pastoral Care**

- Giving data can be leveraged to understand congregational engagement, prompt pastoral connections, and measure ministry effectiveness.
- Digital discipleship is about fostering relationships and moving disciples along a path using digital tools—connecting, following up, and auditing for accountability.
- Privacy and intentionality are key: use data wisely, separate access tiers, and focus on spiritual outcomes.
### Next Steps for Implementation

- **Reallocate Resources**: Shift budget and staff focus to support digital ministry initiatives and hold digital teams accountable to mission-driven outcomes.
- **Empower Teams and Volunteers**: Provide the right tools, cast a clear vision, and integrate volunteerism into digital ministry efforts.
- **Adopt New Rock Features**: Begin planning for Helix adoption, automation migration, and AI agent integration. Evaluate current workflows and content strategies for modernization.
- **Leverage Data for Discipleship**: Set up processes to use giving and engagement data for pastoral care, next-step prompts, and effectiveness measurement—while maintaining privacy and discernment.
- **Continuous Learning and Evaluation**: Stay rooted in mission, evaluate new tools and services with discernment, and embrace the discomfort that comes with innovation.
