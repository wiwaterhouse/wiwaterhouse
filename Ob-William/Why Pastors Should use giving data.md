### A Word of Caution
- Data can be misleading if we're not careful
### Giving Data can help us
- Understand where peeps at
- recognize when giving might be next step
- measure effectiveness
- Prompt the right pastoral connection with right person at right time
### Understanding where people are
- Ever given?
- Regularly?
- Tithing?
- Irrationally generous? ðŸ‘€
### Next step
- give something
- set up a recurring gift
- return to God our first and best
- When was the last time you gave an felt it? - ew
### Measure effectiveness
- Are things we doing working?
- Will new things we try work?
	- ask small before asking big
### Connecting Pastorally
- data can trigger care
- stops - how can I pray for you?
- starts - what is God doing in your lfe?
### Balancing Data Privacy
- What is the business need for access?
	- Tiers of access (separating names and amounts for the majority)
- leverage giving data without the dollar amounts
