Good morning!

Couple of quick changes to be aware of this morning to RockHelp.

We added 3 new boxes

Priority - A better control for marking priority
Congregation - To better support
Ministry Team - To better support


Good morning!

For anyone using (or will use) RockHelp on our Support page, we wanted to communicate just a couple minor changes we made this morning. Otherwise, feel free to ignore this and have a great day!

We added 3 new boxes to RockHelp to better help our team organization and to better support y'all.
- Priority - Finally dedicated so you don't need to remember where to add it!
- Urgent is not on the list. If an urgent issue comes up, please call us at 479-659-3625 option 1
- Congregation - Pretty straight-forward, pick your team's congregation
- Ministry - Similarly straight-forward, pick your team

All of these can be edited after you add a new support project, so don't panic if you need anything changed!

As always, please let me know if you have any questions!
