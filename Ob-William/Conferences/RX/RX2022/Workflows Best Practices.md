Logging Level - turn off

Maximum Workflow Age - new in v13, storing number of days

Completed workflow retention period

Persisted workflows - automatic is bad for the webpage, only persist once you have data to store

        can NOT persist workflows

1. Creating notes
2. add to group
3. write interaction
4. send a message
5. create connection
6. update another record

Thoughtful persistance

Workflow descriptions, ADD INFO, template-ize it, can use markdown

Activities run all actions, actions can mark activities as active, then processes next active activities

Activity sequencing

Forms:

Custom button styles

Back button

Form only in activity, no more actions

Attribute can be fed/filled from the url using the key in the url

GUIDs can feed from URL as well

#note community/lava/workflows for cool stuff

Don’t trust the input, make non-guessable, passing in another record is probably best using GUID

Launcher workflow > workflow to launch another workflow DONT PERSIST

PersonId and GroupId, rock goes and gets the entity and uses that in the workflow, not needed to define person as attribute on the workflow

Workflow entry block, ensure public is set to only specific workflow entry

Other way to collect input:

Content channel item entry block, once configured, very basic input

Connection requests - connection request sign-up block, Categories are tabs in the connection requests

Single purpose workflows:

Don’t store data in workflows
