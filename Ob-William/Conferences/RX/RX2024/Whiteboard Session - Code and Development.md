What is Obsidian?
- Streamlined down
- Client-based rendering
	- Current webforms is all server side rendering
- Set of practices and patterns for development

Getting started with C#
- Libraries - learn what they are/do
- MS youtube channel @dotnet
- MS docs
- Read some blocks code
- CodeCademy for C#

Potential collab projects, maybe outside RX

#followup Need to make a list of any code that is looking at specific ID numbers or classes that may be targeted by stylings that are not obsidian.
