- Lava is just a templating language
- Gets data by entity framework, not directly from database
- Attributes vs properties
	- Attributes slow, properties fast
	- Harder to use, easier to use
- Properties use Ids, Attributes use GUIDs
- RawValue parameter will print out what is stored in the database
- Object parameter will return the whole object with all properties
- Can use a property as a parameter

Lava is Lazy (Entity Framework)
- Entity framework only gets data when you ask for it*
	- Wont get more data than asked
	- Can make many trips to database
	- can cause extra load, especially when using loops
- Does this matter?
	- internally, communication, workflow - probs not
	- Website - probs yes
- Caching
	- Set cache on blocks
	- Easy, but some caveats
		- currentperson doesnt work
		- stylesheet no worky
		- javascript no worky
	- Cache key and duration, twopass = true to process individual lava while caching
	- Permissions for cached pages problem
	- Cached as the first person saw it
	- Internationalization also can break with caching
	- Persisted dataset can help
		- Caches the data, not the output
- Lava webhooks
	- Load more data on page button
		- O data, do not use on web
		- Can define limits to content items
	- Can do lots of things with these

Lava and Permissions
- PERMISSIONS
	- DONT TRUST USERS
	- Make sure things are limited to make sure URL can't access things that are supposed to be locked down
	- Parameters for SQL ALWAYS
	- DO NOT PUT LAVA IN YOUR SQL, use parameters ALWAYS
