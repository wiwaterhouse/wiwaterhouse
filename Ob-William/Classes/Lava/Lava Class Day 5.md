### Session 17 - Performance
- Cache
	- Rock is fast, templates and customizations may slow down
	- Cached records
		- Defined values/types
		- Campus
		- Page
		- Block
		- Attribute, NOT VALUES
		- (more in lava documentation)
	- Entity commands and SQL go to database by default
	- | FromCache:'EntityTYpe' for entity commnands to go get from cache
	- Adding cache yourself
		- Block settings
	- Partially-Cached content
		- {% cache key:'key' duration:'3600' %} {% endcache %} to specify parts to cache
		- {% raw %} {{ something personalized }} {% endraw %} twopass:'true' in cache command to get the lava to process
- Request Efficiency
	- Limit number of database lookups, slowest type
	- Every attribute lookup, requires database lookup
	- multiple . means more database lookups
	- Persisted Datasets
		- Stored as JSON
		- Refreshed on schedule
### Session 18 - Other Topics
- Azure Management plugin #folloup not sure what this is used for
- Naming Things
	- Make sure keys are type-able
	- Consider context of keys
	- Clarity is the name of the game
- Don't repeat yourself
	- DRY = Single Source of Truth
	- Data views
	- One Event, many occurrences
	- Lava Short Codes
		- #followup replace code snippets with short codes
- Rigging
	- What is it? A collection of components which support and control what you're doing
	- Large processes have a lot of data
	- Persisted Dataset
		- Stored in JSON and cached on specified interval
		- Reminder, use | PersistedDataset filter to acccess
	- Your Event (example)
		- look at the slides #followup
- Code Smell
	- Code less clear
	- hard to maintain
	- may indicate deeper issues, opportunities for unintended consequenses
	- be aware of any lava in HTML comments, they still run
	- When using lava, make sure using most effecient route avaialbe
		- Model map useful in this
	- Process can have smell, too many pieces
- Elegance
	- Limit abstraction layers
	- Keep data seperate from template wherever possible
		- Dataset is only the info
		- HTML template and markup is how to display
### Final Q&A
- File Types
	- Databes = secure
	- File system != secure
	- Blob storage = secure
- QUESTION: best practices for caching images? Where are images cached, persisted datasets?
	- width and height in the url, stored in filesystem as a copy once it's generated
	- #followup search on page source for any GetImage without size limiters
- Reports
	- Lava fields have access to any columns added to the report, can uncheck show in grid for anything you need to make available to more easily get data
	- can access by the name of the column, no need for row.Name
