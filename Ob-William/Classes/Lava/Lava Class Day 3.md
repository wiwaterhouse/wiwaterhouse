	- uses bootstrap 3.4, check there for more documentation
- Block Settings
	- Enable versioning and require approval both need to be enabled at the same time
	- Entity context can be used in conjunction with page parameters to filter to specific entities
	- Then can get {{ Context.Property }}
		- | Debug will list out any context on the page
- TURN OFF PERSISTANCE FOR WORKFLOWS WHEREVER POSSIBLE
### Session 9 - Making Things Beautiful

- Rock Downhill - custom design framework integrating multiple frameworks, specific to Rock

	- Other frameworks
- Bootstrap Grid
	- Full width by default
	- .row CSS to define width by value of 12 columns
	- xs, sm, md, lg is screen size for col-md-6

	- More auto-sizing features
	- Fills all available space by default

	- Panels
		- Can enable panel titles on some blocks
		- Makes everything internal to Rock look native
- Tailwind Colors
	- use classes to apply colors, they're pre-defined in this format bg-red-400
### Session 10 - Entity Command - INSIDE THE CASTLE WALLS
- Safe against SQL database changes from core
- Beginning notes:
	- RawValue typically returns Guid
	- INSIDE entity command filter, all properties and attributes are avaialable by just key name, no need for person.key
	- Dataview filter, for when the dataview needs to be the single source of truth
	- Respects security by default, can disable by securityenabled:'false'
		- Can speed up performance where security is not needed
	- Can re-label the entityItems with iterator:'string'
- Expressions
	- expression augments where in addition 
	- More .Properties = more trips to database
		- disabling lazyload is faster, but limited to only properties based on the initial conditions
- include:'PersonAlias.Person, StepStatus' - this tells the entity command to also load this stuff when run and lazyloadenabled:'false'
- select: 'new( PersonAlias.Person.NickName as NickName,
	PersonAlias.Person.LastName as LastName,
	StepStatus Name as Status)'
	- Basically select is building a SQL query manually instead of lazyload or using just include, very fast
- selectmany used when trying to return a specific value result related but not directly connected to the entity, uses . notation to pivot to the value wanted to return
- Aggregates
	- can use Count() in above selects
	- groupby
### Session 11 - SQL Command - OUTSIDE THE CASTLE WALLS
- {{ results | ToJSON }} can be useful for getting this stuff
- can for loop through results, including the . notation
- ALWAYS add | SanatizeSql to the end of any inputs
- OR parameterize the SQL at the top of the sql command
	- adds the value to a sql parameeter @var
- if command is needed to run, use {% sql statement:'command' %} then can update, insert, delete
	- {{ results }} then only shows the count of rows affected by the command
- can store query as a shortcode, then call it in html
- check out the SQL map in Rock Shop #followup helix.triumph.tech for documentation
