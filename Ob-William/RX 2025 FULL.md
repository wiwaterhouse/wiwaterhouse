# First Principles - Rebuilding Digital Ministry from the Ground Up
### Five Key questions
- What is our why?
	- In moments of disruptions, we need clarity
	- Not in analogy, in truth
	- Mission over methos
- What is digital ministry?
	- application of digital tools to amplify the mission of the church

	- Anchors:
		- Break the Sunday-only mold
		- Empower through participation
			- Work through our people, not just on our people
			- SEO vs GPO, God's people optimization
			- Church and seekers
		- Integrate not isolate
			- not digital or analogue, its combo of both
		- Measure what matters
			- Elevate spiritual growth and life cahnge above other interactions
		- Stay Rooted
			- digital tools should not something
- What trends should we be paying attention to?
	- Change one - how content is consumed
		- More AI agents
		- consumption highly curated
		- content will be subjectively summarized
		- AI will hamper direct access to sources
	- Change two - how content is discovered
		- Click-through rate plummeting
		- bypass SEO
- How do we get started?
	- Content is king
		- If no content, Find noursishment elsewhere
		- if no content, go hungry
	- Generate more content
	- Re-purpose content
		- clips
	- curate
	- Empower your people
		- right tools
		- create content worth sharing
		- cast clear vision

		- prioritize mission of methods
		- Integrate volunteerism into digital ministry
- Closing Thoughts
	- Eval tools and services with discernment
	- digital ministry is next gold rush
		- miner focused on th evalue of the outcome
		- some tool provicers focus on quick returns
			- there are no silver bullets
		- we should not emulate business, borrow what's useful and reject what's not

# Why Pastors Should use giving data
### A Word of Caution
- Data can be misleading if we're not careful
### Giving Data can help us
- Understand where peeps at
- recognize when giving might be next step
- measure effectiveness
- Prompt the right pastoral connection with right person at right time
### Understanding where people are
- Ever given?
- Regularly?
- Tithing?
- Irrationally generous? 👀
### Next step
- give something
- set up a recurring gift
- return to God our first and best
- When was the last time you gave an felt it? - ew
### Measure effectiveness
- Are things we doing working?
- Will new things we try work?
	- ask small before asking big
### Connecting Pastorally
- data can trigger care
- stops - how can I pray for you?
- starts - what is God doing in your lfe?
### Balancing Data Privacy
- What is the business need for access?
	- Tiers of access (separating names and amounts for the majority)
- leverage giving data without the dollar amounts

# AI Agents
Not in v18
### AI is NON Deterministic
### What is an AI Agent
- system uses AI to pursue goals an complete tasks on behalf of users
### More than an Agent
- Framework
- Prompt engineering best practices
- context engineering best practices
- Documentation
- Toolkit for dev
### Anatomy of an Agent
- In rock, can create multiple agents
- Agents have skills
	- person
	- group
- Skills have tools
	- Person, search person tool
- Each tool/skill can be secured
- Use-case
	- Chat | MCP - talking to other agents outside of Rock
	- Internal | Public
- A TON of built-in tools and core utilities
- Tool for currentPerson to be available for public, if we want to provide that for our congregations
### Definitions
- Orchestrator - Coordinates interaction between the model, tools, memory, and other components to achieve goals efficiently. Talks to models, we choose
	- GPT 5 best for now
- Models - the intelligence engine that powers reasoning and decision making in AI agents.
- Memory and Knowledge - Storing and getting info including context
- Skills and Tools - interfaces that allow agents to interact with external system APIs and perform actions in the real world
- Audio and Speech
### Agent Types
- Rock embedded agent
- External Agents
- #followup go look up n8n
### Registering Tools
- .well-known/ai-tools.json for what tools are available
- API keys will be able to be added to person profiles directly for access stuff
### Remaining Challenges
- Speed (not Rock but the models)
- Memory
	- Agent
	- Knowlegebase
- Voice
- Tool Authoring
- Security
### Phase 2
- RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation
- More Knowledge base
- Graphs
### Next Steps
- Additional services and subscriptions required?
- Implementation strategies within the UI
- Knowledge base design and architecture

# Rock Automation
- Rock Automation to be available in v18
- replacement for workflow triggers
### Automation
- pattern for reacting to things
- Composed of triggers and events
- triggers are activated by components in Rock
### Automation Triggers
- All changes happen post-save
- Can have multiple criteria for triggers
### Automation Events
- Can have multiple things being done by automation
- Drop-down for event types
	- Launch workflow
	- Lava run
	- Log message
### Plugin Support
- Yes!
- Coming in a few dot releases in v18

How long will workflow triggers be supported moving forward? Will there be a migration path to convert existing workflow triggers?

## AI Gen Notes from recording:
1.  Problem with Existing Workflows
  * Old workflows:
    * Custom actions were difficult to manage.
    * Lacked clear names and descriptions.
    * Hard to remember purpose or reason for workflows.
    * Filtering and grouping was cumbersome.
    * Workflows consumed many CPU cycles and were inefficient.
  * Pain points:
    * Confusing bottom-right filters/criteria in UI.
    * Required constant reference to documentation.
    * Precursor triggers were limited and mostly state-level.
2\. Introduction of Automations
  * Concept:
    * Automations replace old, rudimentary workflows.
    * Pattern for reacting to events using:
      1. Triggers (what starts it)
      2. Events (what it does in response)
    * Key features:
      1. One automation can react to a single trigger but fire multiple events.
      2. Streamlined UI for better clarity on what triggers the automation.
3\. Triggers
  * Trigger behavior:
    * Activated by entity changes (e.g., group updates).
    * Monitor for actions like added, modified, deleted.
  * Criteria/Filters:
    * Example: Monitor GroupTypeId for value 17.
    * Options for:
      * Any change
      * Change from a specific value
      * Change to a specific value
      * Change from one value to another
    * Can combine rules with Advanced Syntax (dynamic link/Lava).
      * Supports complex expressions and keyword matching.
    * Matching logic:
      * “All must match” or “Any can match” for execution.
4\. Events
  * Event types:
    1. Workflow: Launches a workflow.
    2. Lava Event: Executes Lava commands.
    3. Logging Message: Writes to internal log.
    4. Internal Event (testing phase): For new CAT system.
  * Event configuration:
    1. Can toggle events active/inactive without deleting automation.
    2. Multiple events can exist under a single automation.
  * Examples of event actions:
    1. Run a workflow with formatted data.
    2. Execute Lava for API calls, custom logic, or database updates.
    3. Log changes or interactions for auditing.
5\. Advanced Behavior
  * Logging & Debugging:
    * Detailed logs available for automation events.
    * Merge fields provide:
      * Changed entity
      * Person who made the change
      * Original values (dictionary)
      * Modified property names
      * Change state (add/update/delete)
    * Performance & Caching:
      * Automations run efficiently but still require care with DB updates.
      * Direct SQL updates could require cache clearing.
      * Lava commands handle cache refresh automatically.
6\. Extensibility & Future Plans
  * Adding new triggers and event types expected in future releases.
  * Community contributions will be possible once UI stability is ensured.
  * Current focus on entity triggers, but potential for more (e.g., people workflows).
