# Notes

William needs an account in the live Open Path environment
When we can get access to the Open Path live environment
Need to know specific dates for devices (not a two-week time frame)
Need to know if 412 Annex will be associated with FAY conversion

- Open Path will be built out in software first
	- Add all devices to Events2HVAC prior to install
- Fellowship environment will be deployed once Open Path order is in, giving us access after the initial deployment
	- ETA: within this or next week
- 412 Annex: will be its own install day, still on the Rogers campus
