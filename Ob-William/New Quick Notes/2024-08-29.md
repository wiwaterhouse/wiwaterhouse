# Weekly Priorities
1. Medical Release Workflow - DONE
2. Alta Open & E2H
---
# Notes
 10-15k for rollout
 tripling of azure costs
 Ongoing mgmt for dev and updates
 tripling management and monitoring

Middle of road, doubling (maybe less)
5-10k range for rollout
more research required for ongoing maintenance

All would require drills and documentation reviews regularly


where we are now, geo-redundant backups
restore from backup, longer time but we already have it
