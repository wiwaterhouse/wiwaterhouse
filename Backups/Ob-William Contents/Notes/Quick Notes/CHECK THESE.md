CHECK ON GRAPH BLOCKS

FROM NOTEPAD:

SMS Config/process
- Opt-in/out EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
- For twilio, charity, conversational for the message use-case
	- copy examples from the other use case, should be fine
- Contribution and year-end giving statements - WHEN TO SEND?
	- got the templates all set up (mostly) with help from Christy today 10/21
	- Meet with John and Glenda about format of email template to send out
- Julia Petry has started a few PFS workflows that need to be deleted
- Update documentation for contribution statements on Rock Tech Docs so we know where to find everything that needs updated

# Weather - Check for other church solutions
## Rock Calendar

- multiple calendars
- test calendar
- Banner images borked still
	- identity as example
- Group status missing for staff
